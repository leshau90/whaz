##identifying the gap
	*there is not enough studies on certain topics (lack of or insufficeint studies in certain topics), example: 
		**geographical gap, that is, there is not enough study in particular area such as in south east asia but the study is extensively researched in europe
		**population gap, extensively studied on men yet noe on women, or on children, or on high income  
	
	*there is a lack of understanding, or there is a kind of controversy on certain topic, such as when researchers present different explanation for a cause of a certain phenomenon, or a different way of approaching a particular problem 
	
	*limitation of previous studies, mostly written in conclusion part
